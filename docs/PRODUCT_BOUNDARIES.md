# Decision Cover™ — Product Boundaries (LOCKED v1)

## What we are
A proof-first decision cover:
- intake → normalize → decide → evidence → export
- designed to help agencies justify decisions with client-safe proof packs

## What we are NOT
- Not a “guaranteed outcome” engine
- Not a predictive AI oracle
- Not a CRM replacement
- Not a full ticketing platform (we keep it minimal)
- Not storing secrets in UI

## Allowed claims (safe)
- “Documented decisions with evidence you can export”
- “Vendor-neutral intake via webhooks”
- “Transparent signals and written reasons”
- “Evidence ZIP for client/auditor sharing”

## Forbidden claims
- “We guarantee performance”
- “We predict outcomes”
- “We ensure compliance by default”
- Any medical/legal promises without a professional scope

## Privacy posture
- Collect only what is needed
- Keep raw payloads for traceability (tenant-scoped)
- Use hashes in evidence packs when possible
