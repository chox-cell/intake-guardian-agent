Intake-Guardian — 30s sales story

Clients send requests everywhere (WhatsApp/email/DMs). You lose context, proof, and time.
We give each client ONE private link to view and track requests (status/priority).
When delivery is done, you export a CSV as proof for billing and disputes.
Result: faster response, clean evidence, and one source of truth.

CTA:
“Send me your request via this link.”
