## Master Hash
MASTER_HASH: 43fc1841bc8fe46138f3fed4a48b95776764b0dc203084c1e8067ea5151f3bb3

## Scope
- This repository is governed by SSOT + Manifest integrity checks.
- Agents must NOT add features beyond explicitly requested tasks.
- Any change that modifies runtime behavior MUST be deliberate and reviewed.

## Rules
1) Do not edit `.env*`, `data/`, secrets.
2) Only edit files required for the requested task.
3) After changes: run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm integrity:verify`.
4) Only the owner updates MASTER_HASH when a milestone is accepted.

## Notes
- MASTER_HASH is computed from `governance/manifest.json` (sha256).
